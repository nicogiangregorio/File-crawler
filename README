= File Crawler =
================

This code is about a very simple file crawler, 
which allows to traverse a tree of filesystem starting from a given root folder and returns a map of pairs:

[FILEPATH - HASH]

where HASH is the binary content of file hashed with a given function.(You can pass "MD5", "SHA" or whatever you want among them supported by Java).

It is multithreaded.
You can define a pool of worker threads sizing a core dimension of pool, a maximum size, waiting time before discard a thread and size of tasks queue (tasks: files to be processed).
Don't worry about saturation policy of queue, because it is managed by library.

Further more you can define a buffer size of IO reading operation.
